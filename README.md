The foundation of the Grocery Store project in based on a MySQL database. 
The provided files in the MySQL folder will help you to set up the necessary schema for making this project work.

Next, the DB is hosted on an Apache server via XAMPP.
!! THE PHP FILES WILL NEED TO BE CHANGED TO REFLECT THE SERVER ON YOUR MACHINE !!
The $host, $name, and $pwd fields will need to be modified.

The grocery_store folder should be placed into the htdocs folder of XAMPP.
Finally, you may access the website.html homepage on your Apache server.
